Print wirelessly from [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software), [PrusaControl](http://prusacontrol.org/), or [Slic3r PE](https://github.com/prusa3d/Slic3r/releases) to your 3D printer connected to an [ESP8266](https://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview) module.

__UNDER DEVELOPMENT__. See [Issues](https://github.com/probonopd/WirelessPrinting/issues). Pull requests welcome!

## Hardware

WEMOS D1 mini modules can be used. Also, ESP32 modules can be used (e.g., TTGO-T1 with built-in microSD card slot).

The WEMOS D1 mini module is connected with your 3D printer via the serial connection and to a SD card (acting as a cache during printing). You need to connect
* TX, RX from your 3D printer to the WEMOS D1 mini module (__AUX-1__ header on RAMPS boards). Note: For ESP32, use GPIO32 = RX, GPIO33 = TX
* Power and GND from your 3D printer to the WEMOS D1 mini module (attention, the __AUX-1__ header on RAMPS boards has 5V while the ESP8266 needs 3.3V but the WEMOS D1 mini has a voltage regulator)
* Optional: SD card shield to the WEMOS D1 mini module (a capacitor across the power pins of the SD card; SD shields have this). Using a SanDisk 2 GB card formatted with `mkfs.vfat` on Linux seems to work for me. If no SD card is connected, then the internal SPIFFS memory (3 MB) is used. For TTGO-T1, the built-in microSD card slot is used if a card is inserted.
* A matching case for a WEMOS D1 mini module and microSD shield can be found at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2287618

## esp8266/Arduino sketch

The [esp8266/Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) sketch `ESP8266WirelessPrintAsync.ino` is uploaded to a ESP8266 module. See `.travis.yml` for how this is compiled on Travis CI.

### Building

Pre-built binaries are available for download on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/probonopd/WirelessPrinting/releases).

The following build procedure works on Linux:

```
# Get PlatformIO (the toolchain we use for compiling)
git clone https://github.com/probonopd/WirelessPrinting
cd WirelessPrinting
wget -c https://downloads.egenix.com/python/install-pyrun
bash install-pyrun --python=3.5 pyrun/
pyrun/bin/pip3 install -U platformio==4.2.1

# Build the firmware (it downloads the needed libraries)
pyrun/bin/platformio run
ls -lh ./build_output/firmware/*.bin
```

### Flashing from Linux

Can be flashed via USB or (subsequently) over the air. You can use PlatformIO to upload to either OTA and flash via any known flash method. See e.g., https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif8266.html#over-the-air-ota-update, https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif32.html#packages.

If you are not using PlatformIO (e.g., because you are just interested in uploading our pre-built firmware as quickly as possible) you may use the following instructions.

#### ESP8266

```
# USB
sudo chmod a+rwx /dev/ttyUSB0 ; /tmp/.mount_*/usr/bin/hardware/esp8266/esp8266/tools/esptool/esptool -vv -cd nodemcu -cb 921600 -cp /dev/ttyUSB0 -ca 0x00000 -cf ESP8266WirelessPrint*.bin

# Wireless
wget -c "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esp8266/Arduino/master/tools/espota.py"
python espota.py -i 192.168.0.27 -p 8266 --auth= -f ESP8266WirelessPrint*.bin
```

##### ESP32

```
# USB
sudo apt install python-serial
sudo chmod a+rwx /dev/ttyUSB0 ; python $HOME/.arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool_py/2.6.0/esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x10000 ESP8266WirelessPrintAsync_esp32_*.bin

# Wireless
python $HOME/.arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/1.0.1/tools/espota.py -i 192.168.0.16 -p 3232 --auth= -f ESP8266WirelessPrintAsync_esp32_*.bin
```

After the initial flashing, you can upload new versions of this firmware from the web interface without any further tools.

## Initial WiFi Configuration
Following the instrucions in https://github.com/alanswx/ESPAsyncWiFiManager/ : 

The first time the sketch is uploaded the ESP will enter in Access Point mode, so you have to open the wifi manager of your system and connect to wifi "AutoConnectAP", then open your browser and type http://192.168.4.1/, there you will see a menu, select "Configure WiFi", press scan and wait until the device scans available networks and select yours, enter the the password and click save. It will try to connect to your network, if it's successfull you will see a message on your 3D printer (or in a serial monitor if conected to your computer) with the new device IP, write down this IP if you wish to connect via browser. 

## Wireless printing with Cura

Cura 2.6 and later come with a bundled plugin which discovers OctoPrint instances using Zeroconf and enables printing directly to them. In newer versions of Cura, you need to install the [Cura OctoPrint Plugin](https://github.com/fieldOfView/Cura-OctoPrintPlugin) from the "Toolbox" menu. To use it,
- In Cura, add a Printer matching the 3D printer you have connected to WirelessPrint
- Select "Connect to OctoPrint" on the Manage Printers page
- Select your OctoPrint instance from the list
- Enter an API key (for now a random one is sufficient)
- Click "Connect", then click "Close"
From this point on, the print monitor should be functional and you should see a "Print with OctoPrint" button on the bottom of the sidebar. Use this button to print wirelessly.

## Wireless printing with PrusaControl

Currently a custom fork, [PrusaControlWireless](https://github.com/probonopd/PrusaControl/tree/WirelessPrinting), is required. This may change in the future.

## Wireless printing with Slic3r PE

Slic3r PE 1.36.0 and later discovers OctoPrint instances using Zeroconf and enables printing directly to them. No further software needs to be installed. To use it,
- In Slic3r PE, add the corresponding profile for your printer
- Select the "Printer Settings" tab
- Under "OctoPrint upload", enter the IP address of your WirelessPrinting device (in the future, it may be discoverable by Bonjour)
- Click "Test"
From this point on, you should see a "Send to printer" button on the "Plater" tab. Use this button to print wirelessly.

## Wireless printing using a browser or the command line

To print, just open http://the-ip-address/ and upload a G-Code file using the form:

![Upload](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2480569/23586936/fd0e3fa2-01a0-11e7-9d83-dc4e7d031f30.png)

Ycan also print from the command line using curl:

```
curl -F "file=@/path/to/some.gcode" -F "print=true" http://the-ip-address/print
```
